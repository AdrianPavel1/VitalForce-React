# Vital Force
Here is my fully functional responsive website project.
It contains 2 folders, 1 with mySQL DB and one with React website.
NOTE: This project is created to apply my computer science knowledge, not for sale or reuse by others.

#What is this project about
This project is about fitness and is dedicated to two main types of people: those who want to lose weight and those who want to build muscle.

In the progress section, you can track your meals based on the calendar, and on days when you achieve your eating goals, the calendar will highlight that day in green.

The custom meal section is a page where you can see different types of meals suited to your fitness goals.

**how to start**

1. In order to start the project after downloading all the files, go to VSCode or whatever code editor you use and type in the console the following commands, followed by an enter (to see the project in the browser):

First command: cd vital-force

Second command: npm run dev

This will give a localhost link, and you can access it on any browser.

2. Change the .env with your downloaded DB data from the program file :
vital-force/server/.env (e.g, my .env looks like that:)
DB_HOST="localhost"
DB_USER="root"
DB_PASSWORD=""
DB_NAME="vf"
PORT = 3000


3. In a new console, write the following to start the server and connect to the DB:

First command: cd vital-force/server
Second command: npm start


4. If you want to see the experience of an old user, you can log in with the following :
