# my-projects
There is my latest project and responsive project.
It contains 2 folders, 1 with mySQL DB and one with React website.

#how to start
1.
In order to start the project after downloading all the files , go in VsCode or whatever code editor you use and type in console (to see the project in browser):
cd vital-force
npm run dev

this will give a localHost link.

2.Change the .env with you'r downloaded DB data from the program file :
vital-force/server/.env

3.
In a new console write the following to start the server:
cd vital-force/server
npm start

this will help you connect to to DB. 

4.If you want to see the experience of an old user you can log in with the following : 
user: Adrian11@gmail.com
password:11



Note: I am currently developing my skills in website security.
