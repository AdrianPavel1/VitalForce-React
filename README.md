# Vital Force
There is my latest project and responsive project.
It contains 2 folders, 1 with mySQL DB and one with React website.

#What is this project about
This project is about fitness and is dedicated to two main types of people: those who want to lose weight and those who want to build muscle.

In the progress section, you can track your meals based on the calendar, and on days when you achieve your eating goals, the calendar will highlight that day in green.

The custom meal section is a page where you can see different types of meals suited to your fitness goals.

#how to start
